# container-networking-notes

rough, early draft, crazy ideas about where we might go with OSS Container Networking efforts.

* [Policy](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/container-networking-notes/blob/master/policy.md):
Description of ways we could enforce policy
* The [Why](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/container-networking-notes/blob/master/why-extract-api.md) and [How](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/container-networking-notes/blob/master/how-extract-api.md) of extracting Network functionality from the Garden API
* [Internal Routes](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/container-networking-notes/blob/master/internal-routes.md):
A proposal for creating names for service discovery of apps deployed to cloudfoundry
* [External Services](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/container-networking-notes/blob/master/external-services.md):
A description of ways apps will need to connect to things that are not apps, such as databases outside of the CF cluster or services deployed by BOSH.
